- âš¡ All those repositories are fun. most my repositories are pirvate, because of easy reason. Codes belongs to companies i worked for and i can't share. but repos you can see are tasks from University or Just bunch of junk while i was trying to create something ...
- some of them also are for my students. I used to be lecturer at university.
